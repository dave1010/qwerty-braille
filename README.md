# Qwerty Braille

By Dave Hulbert.

# About

This is a web page that allows you to use a normal qwerty keybaord like a Braille keyboard or Perkins Brailler.

The letters f, d, s, j, k, l are used to represent the 6 dots. You need a keyboard that supports multi-key rollover, so this won't work on all devices.

# Limitations

Only single characters are implemented. QWerty Braille doesn't support Braille's other features, like contractions or multi-chord actions. that means you can't type numbers or use any shorthand.
